# PEACH

I joined Dr. Harvey Seim's [Observational Physical Oceanography Lab](https://tarheels.live/seimlab/) in my spring semester freshman year at UNC (2023). In 2016–2017, my PI led the Processes driving Exchange at Cape Hatteras (PEACH) Program, where several scientists made use of various observational instruments to better understand seawater exchange between the continental shelf and open ocean near Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. A couple years later, I am now using some of the data collected from underwater Slocum gliders to observe seawater mixing and their origins.

# iLOSCAR

The burning of fossil fuels since the start of the Industrial Revolution has led to increased CO2 emissions, reaching levels higher than any time in the past 2 million years. In addition to reducing emissions through policy initiatives and transitioning to renewable energy sources, implementing technologies for carbon dioxide removal (CDR) has received growing attention.

In Summer 2024, I joined Dr. Shuang Zhang's [CArbon Cycle and Earth Environment (CACEE) Lab](https://www.caceelab.space/) at Texas A&M University as a part of an REU with the Department of Oceanography. Here, I worked with Dr. Zhang and PhD student Shihan Li to look at how different methods of CDR impact the ocean and atmosphere. Understanding how ocean and atmospheric tracers are impacted by CDR is an important contribution towards building a framework for monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) of CDR projects.

Our medium for studying this is the **i**nteractive **L**ong-term **O**cean-atmosphere-**S**ediment **CA**rbon cycle **R**eservoir (iLOSCAR) model, developed here at Texas A&M University. We used iLOSCAR to run simulations over more than 500 years to see how ocean/atmosphere tracers such as pCO₂, temperature, pH, and saturation states of aragonite and calcite change when we introduce fluxes attributed to CDR. iLOSCAR has both an inverse and forward component, and features a web-based UI that makes running the simulations simpler.

More work on iLOSCAR can be found [here](https://github.com/Shihan150/iloscar).
