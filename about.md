title: "About Me"
---

I am an upcoming fourth-year undergraduate student at UNC Chapel Hill studying environmental sciences and applied mathematics.  

As an undergraduate, I have been exposed to two main disciplines of oceanography: observational physical oceanography with [Dr. Harvey Seim](https://tarheels.live/seimlab/) and geochemical ocean modeling with [Dr. Shuang Zhang](https://www.caceelab.space/).  

My long-term interests include finding a way to combine observations with modeling.
