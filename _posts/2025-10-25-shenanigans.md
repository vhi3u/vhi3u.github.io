this semester has been extremely busy. i have been working on my honors thesis research project, and learning a lot on [Oceananigans](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl). something really funny i want to share is i've been working on this model for months with the bathymetry function i defined completely wrong. well, not completely wrong, but with wrong dimensions. all it took was changing `return x, y, h` to `return x, y, h'`. this is quite hilarious. well, hopefully i can make more progress in these next few weeks. 

i'm also taking the GRE this upcoming week. how fun!
