welcome to my page. 

if you saw my previous page i forked from a github template i apologize. 

the inspiration for this current page came from when i started learning [emacs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs) this summer. it's based off of the [doom nord](https://github.com/doomemacs/themes/tree/screenshots?tab=readme-ov-file#doom-nord) theme. 

the overall function of this website is fairly mixed. i'm trying to keep it as professional *and* personal as possible. 

stay tuned for more updates to this. i was planning on making this as minimal as possible but i've been having a bit too much fun.
