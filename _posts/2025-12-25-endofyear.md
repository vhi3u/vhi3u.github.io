it has been a while since my last post.

semester over, holidays have been enjoyed.

looking forward to the new year, and the completion of my graduate school applications.

also looking to update this page. 

my coursework next semester looks exciting (fluid mechanics, optimization/ml, earth system modeling, and the second part of mathematical methods for physical sciences). debating whether to splurge for physical textbooks or not...

cheers to a bountiful and auspicious 2026.
