title: end of summer
---

starting on monday, i begin school again. it’s cliché to say “oh, how the time flies,” but I am horrified at the thought of my undergraduate career coming to an end. 

one thing i’m looking forward to: my research work. 
one thing i’m scared about: real analysis. i hear it is one of the harder courses here at UNC, but nevertheless, this presents a good opportunity to improve my proof-writing skills and fundamental understanding of calculus. 

there’s a lot of “loose ends” to wrap off this school year. i’m looking to prioritize my research work and hopefully bear some fruits from this long-sought harvest. 

along with my honors thesis work and glider research, i must prepare application materials for graduate school programs. i have to dedicate more time to reaching out to potential adivsors with suitable oceanography programs. in a way, it is a lot of networking that may be an unexpected responsibility. regardless, i’ve had a great time chatting with these advisors, learning about all their work. 

more than ever (and i say this every year) i have to become more organized and efficient with my time. the amount of responsibilities i find myself having increase by the semester, and with that, there is a sense of urgency (read: panic) to manage my time and get things done right and on time. 

i think i will leave it as that here.
